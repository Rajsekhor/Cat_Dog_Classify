# Cat_Dog_Classify
This code is a project provided by [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

This is my first machine learning project so, there are quite a few flaw in my model. The current model gave an accuracy of 72% during the last test run.

To build the model, I took reference from multiple sites and project of fellow peers. 

I will try to improve the accuracy in later versions of the model.

For this challenge, I had to use TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs with at least 63% accuracy.
